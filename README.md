# Express-Note-Taker

## Challenge Description
For this challenge, the Express.js framework has been used to create a server-side API. This application allows users to write, view and delete notes. Both GET and POST requests have been used to view and submit information to the server when the endpoints are visited.
Express.js, fs, path and uuid modules have been used to handle the application.


## Installation Process
* To run this application locally, clone this repository and open in a text editor. You will need to access CLI and install the required packages as part of Node.js. Invoke the server.js file in the terminal and navigate to "localhost:8080" to launch the application. 

* This application is also hosted on <a>Heroku</a>
